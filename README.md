This is a data analytics case study completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It focuses on a company called Bellabeat.

The data is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/discussion?resource=download&page=2) and is covered under the [CC0: Public Domain Liscence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

The technology used for analysis is R and the analysis can be found in the R markdown file. R was chosen do to it's ability to easily create visualizations and the ability to sift through the amount of data in some of the larger files (though ultimitaley the files that ended up being the most relevant were the ones with fewer rows).
